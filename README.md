# Movie Table

This is a simple React app that has a table of movies and a delete button. When the user clicks the delete button, the corresponding row is removed. This app is to demonstrate React basics.
Users can also search for movies with results showing up as they type.
There is a MongoDB backend to persist the data from Mosh's project: https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/vidly-api-node
